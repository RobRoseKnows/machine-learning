# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Proposal

In this paper I outline my proposal for my Udacity Machine Learning Engineer capstone
project. I plan on using the Kaggle [Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction][1]
competition to use as the surrounding premise of my project. I hope to explore
ensembling techniques such as stacking and blending in order to make an effective model.

## Domain Background

Data Science competitions are a common main stay of modern data science, pioneered by
[The Netflix Prize][2] in 2007. I believe entering one of them is an ideal way for me
to apply what I've learned in the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree program.
